#  Worst case time complexity = 
#   maximum running time that an algorithm take for input size n.
#  consider an input for which algorithm take large time.
#  very useful and informative.

#  Best case time complexity = 
#  minimum running time that an algorithm take for input size n.
#  consider an input for which algorithm will take short time.
#  not very useful.

#  Average time complexity = 
#  average running time that an algorithm take for input size n.
#  consider an input for which algorithm will take average time.
#  generally verry difficult.
